## Titans - Pytorch

Unofficial implementation of [Titans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00663) in Pytorch. Will also contain some explorations into architectures beyond their simple 1-4 layer MLP for the neural memory module, if it works well to any degree.

## Appreciation

- [Eryk](https://github.com/sentialx) for sharing his early experimental results with me, positive for 2 layer MLP

## Install

```bash
$ pip install titans-pytorch
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from titans_pytorch import NeuralMemory

mem = NeuralMemory(
    dim = 384,
    chunk_size = 64 # set to smaller chunk size for better perf on smaller sequence lengths (but more memory usage)
).cuda()

seq = torch.randn(2, 1024, 384).cuda()
retrieved, mem_state = mem(seq)

assert seq.shape == retrieved.shape
```

A transformer with the `MAC` configuration can be used as

```python
import torch
from titans_pytorch import MemoryAsContextTransformer

transformer = MemoryAsContextTransformer(
    num_tokens = 256,
    dim = 256,
    depth = 2,
    segment_len = 128,              # local attention window size
    num_persist_mem_tokens = 4,
    num_longterm_mem_tokens = 16,
)

token_ids = torch.randint(0, 256, (1, 1023))

loss = transformer(token_ids, return_loss = True) # (1, 1023, 256)
loss.backward()

# after much training

sampled = transformer.sample(token_ids[:, :4], 512)
```

## Experiments

```bash
$ pip install .[examples]
```

Then modify `train_mac.py` and run it to query nature

```bash
$ python train_mac.py
```

## Validating Memory Learning

You can verify that the neural memory module learns within a sequence by running the test script:

```bash
$ python test_memory_simple.py
```

### Example Output

This demonstrates the key property of Titans: **the memory learns during inference** as it processes tokens sequentially.

```
Using device: cuda

=== PROOF: M Learns Within Sequence ===
M should help later tokens more than early tokens

ninja: no work to do.
Loss on tokens 1-256   (M just started): 1.1719
Loss on tokens 769-1024 (M learned 768 tokens): 1.0623

Improvement: 0.1097
✓ M LEARNING WORKS!
  Later predictions are better because M learned from earlier tokens

=== How M Works ===
✓ Within sequence: M learns as it goes (token 1 → 1000)
✓ During generation: M accumulates across generated tokens
✗ Between forward(): M resets (unless using cache in autoregressive mode)

=== Text Generation Demo ===

=== All Tests Complete ===

```

**Key Insight**: The loss improves from **1.1719** (early tokens) to **1.0623** (late tokens) in a single forward pass. This proves that the neural memory `M` accumulates knowledge as it processes the sequence, making predictions better for later tokens.
